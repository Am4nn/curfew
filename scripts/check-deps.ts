// The npm registry records a `deprecated` string per published version. It is
// the only warning a package ever gets to give, it appears once during an
// install and scrolls past, and it is how a dependency becomes unmaintained
// without anybody deciding to keep using it. Read on purpose, it is a fact that
// can gate a merge.
//
// DIRECT dependencies only, the ones in package.json. A deprecated package four
// levels down is its parent's problem and there is nothing to do about it here
// except wait; `bun audit` is what covers that half, on the axis where it
// matters. This asks the question a person can actually answer: is something we
// picked no longer the thing to pick.
//
// Exits non-zero on anything deprecated and not in ALLOWED, so it can gate CI.
