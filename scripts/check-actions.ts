// Is anything the pipeline itself runs on out of date?
//
//   bun run check:actions
//
// The counterpart to `check:deps`, on the axis a lockfile cannot see. Every
// `uses:` line in `.github/workflows/` is a dependency with a version, and
// nothing in this repo has ever looked at one. `actions/checkout@v4` sitting on
// an end-of-life Node was found by an annotation on a green run, which is to
// say by luck: the run passed, the notice scrolled past, and the only reason it
// was noticed at all is that somebody happened to open the log.
//
// Two questions per action, and they are the two a person can act on:
//
//   - Is the repository archived? An archived action is not coming back.
//   - Is the pinned major behind the latest released major? A major is where
//     an action moves its runtime, which is exactly what the checkout notice
//     was about.
//
// A pinned SHA is reported and not judged. That is the supply-chain-safe way to
// pin one, it carries no readable version, and telling somebody their SHA is
// out of date without knowing which release it belongs to would be noise.
//
// Reads the live GitHub API, so this can go red on a morning when nothing in
// the repo changed. That is why it is its own job beside `check:deps` rather
// than part of `check`.
